					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<img id="biopic" src="assets/images/new_cover.jpg" alt="Photo of Anda">

					<p>Anda Szilagyi was born to two concert pianist parents. She spent her early years studying piano, guitar and singing. Growing up in New York City, she was exposed to many different cultures. Her musical career has focused on various types of music spanning styles such as Jazz, Classical, Reggae, Afrobeat, Soul and Brazilian musical traditions.  Anda went on to earn her Bachelors Degree in Jazz Performance on trumpet from the New School and a Masters in Performing Arts Production from Florida International University. She has toured extensively throughout the U.S., Spain, England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Canada, playing with such groups as Antibalas, The Dap Kings, Victor Rice and Kokolo. <br>
					For the past seven years, Anda has spent a lot of time in Brazil, writing, playing and absorbing the culture. During the four years she lived in Salvador, Bahia, she played with quite a few local musicians including singer-songwriter Thiago Kalu and Afrobeat outfit-IFA.  She performed on some of the biggest stages in the city, taking part in local festivals and broadcast performances. 
					Anda has developed her own unique blend of Brazilian, funk and R&B by mixing Brazilian rhythms and language with old school funk grooves and many times adding a touch of electronic texture to the mix.  She currently lives in New York , performing as singer songwriter, collaborating with various musicians on musical projects and studying computer coding at Rutgers University.</p>
